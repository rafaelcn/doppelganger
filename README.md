# Doppelganger

Doppelganger is a duplicate file finder. Giving it a directory initiates a scan 
over that entire folder and marks every duplicated file, giving the duplicated
files result after execution finishes. 

# Beware

This program spins up n number of threads depending on the number of files 
within the given directory. Also, it doesn't do a recursive lookup.
